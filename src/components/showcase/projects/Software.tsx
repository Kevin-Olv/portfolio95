                    kevin-olvera.com is my portfolio website, and also the
                    website you are on right now. I've wanted to create a 
                    portfolio site for a few years now but never found the 
                    time to sit down and convert my resume into a working
                    website. I also struggled deciding how I wanted the site
                    to look. A portfolio allows you to be a bit more creative
                    and share what doesn't fit on your resume. 

                    I've always loved the aesthtic old technology had, software used to have character
                    and over the years we have minimalized it to have no personality. I came across this 
                    Windows 95 theme in another repository and knew I had to adapt it to be my portfolio
                    site's theme.

                            The scene from Blender was baked and exported in a

                    split into two parts, the 3D site, and the 2D OS site. The
                    3D site uses Three.js to render the scene and renders the 2D
                    site inside of it using an iframe. The 2D OS site is a
                    simple react site that is hosted{' '}

                    and works as a standalone web app. The actual rendering of
                    the 2D site is accomplished using a CSS renderer provided by
                    Three.js that transforms the html of the 2D site with 3D CSS
                    transforms to give the illusion of three dimensionality.
