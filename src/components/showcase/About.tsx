                <h3>About Me</h3>
                <br />
                <p>
                Growing up, I always had a fascination with building things, 
                whether that be legos or computers. It wasn’t until college that 
                I realized I love the idea of building something, but I hate actually 
                building things. Legos are great until you realize it’s going to take 
                you 8 hours to put together thousands of pieces of plastic to kiiiind 
                of resemble the Millennium Falcon from Star Wars.

                I wrote my first line of code at 13 when my uncle told me that I 
                wasn’t gonna waste away my summer playing video games and instead 
                I had to learn Python so I can be rich one day and retire him. I didn’t 
                get far beyond print(‘Hello World’). Sorry Sergio, might take a bit longer 
                than you had hoped.

                In 2019, I was accepted to the University of Notre Dame to study Aerospace Engineering. 
                I expected this major to be similar to building that Lego Millenium Falcon just with real 
                parts, I was wrong. Figured I was pretty good at printing ‘Hello World’ so I decided to switch 
                my major to Computer Science.

                        <p>
                            Beyond software, I have a lot of hobbies that I
                            enjoy doing in my free time. The more tangible
                            hobbies I have are{' '}
                            <Link to="/projects/music">Music Production</Link>{' '}
                            and creating{' '}
                            <Link to="/projects/art">Digital Art</Link>. You can
                            read more about each of these on their respective
                            pages under my projects tab. Some other hobbies I
                            enjoy are working out, cooking, and (unsurprisingly)
                            playing video games.

                        <p>
                            In college, I was an active member in the fraternity
                            Sigma Alpha Epsilon and held multiple positions in
                            the chapter. I met a lot of amazing people through
                            my fraternity and thoroughly enjoyed the community.
